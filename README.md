# Weather_forecast_app

Brief Overview:
I developed a Weather Forecast App that provides real-time weather updates and forecasts for any location worldwide. The app uses data from various meteorological sources to deliver accurate and up-to-date weather information.
 
Motivation
I chose this project because I wanted to improve my skills in data integration and API usage, and I saw a practical need for an accurate and user-friendly weather forecasting tool.

Features
The app includes features such as current weather conditions, 7-day forecasts, severe weather alerts, and a user-friendly interface. It also allows users to save favorite locations for quick access.

Technology Stack
The app is built using React Native for cross-platform compatibility on both iOS and Android. I used the OpenWeatherMap API for fetching weather data.
